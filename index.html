                <p class="about">Jacqueline Kharouf is a UX writer. She specializes in writing user-centered content, drafting insightful research plans, and crafting user personas. Jacqueline is a storyteller.<br><br>
                    With her Master of Fine Arts degree in creative writing and her writing experience, Jacqueline knows how to craft a story and to create empathetic, human personas.<br><br>
                    She loves to tackle overlooked (or misunderstood) user problems—such as how a single parent can better book travel accommodations; or how musicians can reach out to fans and collaborators all on one live-streaming platform; or how a local non-profit can raise awareness and keep supporters better informed.<br><br>
                    Jacqueline applies her storytelling, organizational, sketching, and Figma skills to solve user problems. First, she understands a conflict by empathizing with a persona’s motivations and goals, as well as pain points and obstacles. Then she crafts a plan, schedules interviews, creates a survey, and asks questions. Finally, she visualizes a solution for the user, experimenting with structures and shapes that enhance the user’s journey.</p>
